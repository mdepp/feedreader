# Feedreader

A simple RSS feedreader created as a beginner project with Remix.
Uses auth0 for authentication, mikro-orm/postgres for storage, and some PostCSS plugins for styling.
For the most part, it can work without JavaScript enabled.

Feeds are updated hourly by a custom scraper written in Typescript.
